/*Lets Talk about egen.
The egen command is a great tool to use because of its broad functionality.

Let's start simple */

webuse auto.dta, replace
//What is "webuse", webuse opens a stata preloaded dataset from the internet.

egen rank_wgt=rank(weight)
sum rank_wgt
/*here we have ranked the weight of each car. The cars that weigh the same 
are half values. */

bysort foreign: egen max_len=max(length)
/* now we can also see the max length for each group, foreign and domestic. 
Bysort is used to order and seperate the two groups and basically treat them as 
independent groups where you are finding the maximum length for each group. */

gen diff_len=max_len-length
/*we can also generate the difference in length between each car and the largest 
length car within the foreign or domestic group */

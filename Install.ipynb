    "If you have used Stata's `merge` command, you might have had to open the dataset(using dataset) that you want to merge to create/rename ID variables to be the same as master dataset(the data set currently in Stata). This requirement is no longer necessary with the user written package `mmerge`, as this package allows you to specify the using variable that you want to use to match on. Hence, you will no longer have to open and save over a using dataset to create identical variables in order to merge the two datasets. \n",
